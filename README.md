# Objective
The objective of Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in financial systems by analyzing transaction patterns and detecting anomalies. 

### Key activities
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and clean transaction data, ensuring it's structured for analysis by handling missing values and scaling features.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use algorithms like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, or Autoencoders to identify unusual transaction patterns.
- **Supervised Classification**: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) on labeled datasets to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Visualization**: Use tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create charts (e.g., scatterplots) to visually highlight anomalies and transaction trends.
- **Deployment and Monitoring**: Implement the model in real-time systems to continuously monitor transactions and trigger alerts for potential fraud.


### Technologies Used
-**Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.

-**pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

-**matplotlib**: Used for creating static, animated, interactive visualizations.

-**Scikit-learn**: It is a machine learning library in Python used for implementing various algorithms.

-**seaborn**: Used for creating attractive and informative statistical data visualizations, making it easier to explore and understandÂ data.
